ML PROJECTS:

HEART DISEASE PROJECT:

It is a Multi-class Classification machine learning project.in the project I used machine learning algorithms to predict the heart disease.I downloaded the data from kaggle website and that data contains lot of columns include the predictable feature 'Target'.

DATASET:

The dataset used for this project is the heart disease dataset, which contains 14 attributes and 303 instances. The attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. The target variable is the presence of heart disease, which is represented by a binary variable (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease).  To solve this problem, we will use a classification algorithm to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. We will first preprocess the data by performing exploratory data analysis, handling missing values, and scaling the data. We will then train and evaluate several classification models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. We will select  the best model based on its performance on the test set and use it to predict the presence of heart disease in new 
patients.

About Dataset
Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

Content
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

1)Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2)Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3)BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4)SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5)Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6)BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7)DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
8)Age: Age (years)
9)Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

Past Usage:
 1. Smith,~J.~W., Everhart,~J.~E., Dickson,~W.~C., Knowler,~W.~C., \&Johannes,~R.~S. (1988). Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecastthe onset of diabetes mellitus.  In {\it Proceedings of the Symposium
   on Computer Applications and Medical Care} (pp. 261--265).  IEEEComputer Society Press.

The diagnostic, binary-valued variable investigated is whether thepatient shows signs of diabetes according to World Health Organizationcriteria (i.e., if the 2 hour post-load plasma glucose was at least 
200 mg/dl at any survey  examination or if found during routine medicalcare).The population lives near Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

Results: Their ADAP algorithm makes a real-valued prediction between0 and 1.  This was transformed into a binary decision using a cutoff of 0.448.  Using 576 training instances, the sensitivity and specificity
of their algorithm was 76% on the remaining 192 instances.

Relevant Information:
  Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances froma larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females atleast 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  ADAP is an adaptive learning routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like devices.  It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.

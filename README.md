HEART DISEASE PROJECT:

It is a Multi-class Classification machine learning project.in the project I used machine learning algorithm to predict the heart disease.I downloaded the data from kaggle website and that data contains lot of columns include the predictable feature 'Target'.

DATASET:

The dataset used for this project is the heart disease dataset, which contains 14 attributes and 303 instances. The attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. The target variable is the presence of heart disease, which is represented by a binary variable (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease).  To solve this problem, we will use a classification algorithm to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. We will first preprocess the data by performing exploratory data analysis, handling missing values, and scaling the data. We will then train and evaluate several classification models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. We will select  the best model based on its performance on the test set and use it to predict the presence of heart disease in new 
patients.
